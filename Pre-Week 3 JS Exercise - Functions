// Week 2 - Functions

// In the following exercises, you will need to place your code or answer underneath each
// exercise prompt.

// First try answering these without using references or looking up any information.
// Then, check your answer by using references and/or running your code.
// You can run your JS code using the Chrome or Firefox Developer tools, or by using Node.js.
// Feel free to update your answers if you got them wrong at first -- this exercise is for your own learning.
// But make sure you understand why the correct answer is right.

// Exercise 1. Define a function called logGreeting() that prints the string “Hello!” (use console.log).
// Underneath the function, write the line of code that runs the function.

function logGreeting(){
  console.log("Hello!");
}

logGreeting();




// Exercise 2. Define a function called getName() that *returns* a string that is your name.
// Remember, this function should return the string -- not print it.
// Then print your name in the console by passing getName() into the console.log() function.


function getName(myName){
  return myName;
}

console.log(getName("Lex!"))





// Exercise 3. Call a function within a function -- Write a function called logGreeting2()
// that prints a full sentence that contains your name: "Hello! My name is <name>."
// logGreeting2 should call myName() to get your name.
// Then print your greeting to the console by calling logGreeting2().

function logGreeting2(){
  console.log(`Hello! My name is ${getName("Lex")}.`)
}

console.log(logGreeting2())





// Exercise 4. Write a function that takes 3 parameters that are all numbers.
// The function should return the sum of the 3 numbers.
// Then write some function calls you would use to test your function.

function returnSumOfThree(num1, num2, num3){
  return num1 + num2 + num3;
}

console.log(returnSumOfThree(1, 2, 3)) //expected output - 6
console.log(returnSumOfThree(4, 5, 6)) //expected output - 15
console.log(returnSumOfThree(7, 8, 9)) //expected output - 24
console.log(returnSumOfThree("one","two","three")) //expected output onetwothree





// Exercise 5. Let's say a museum gives a discount for children ages 14 or under, and seniors 65 or older.
// Write a function that takes in a person's age and returns true if they should get a discount.
// Otherwise it should return false.
// Then write some function calls you would use to test your function.

function determineDiscount(age){
  if(age <= 14 || age >= 65){
    return true;
  } else {
    return false;
  }
}

console.log(determineDiscount(8)); //expected output - true
console.log(determineDiscount(21)); //expected output - false
console.log(determineDiscount(68)); //expected output - true
console.log(determineDiscount("Three")); //expected output - false





// Exercise 6. Write a function that takes 2 parameters -- one number and one string.
// The function should print the string the given number of times.
// Then write some function calls you would use to test your function.

function printGivenNumTimes(numTimes, strToPrint){
  for(i = 0; i < numTimes; i++){
    console.log(strToPrint);
  }
}

printGivenNumTimes(8, "Eight"); //Expected output - prints `Eight` x8
printGivenNumTimes(3, "Three"); //Expected output - prints `Three` x3





// Exercise 7. Read the following code (don't run it yet)

function mysteryFunction1(p1) {
  return p1 * 2;
}
const y = 4;
const z = mysteryFunction1(y);
console.log("The value of y is " + y);
console.log("The value of z is " + z);

// Without running the code, write down in a comment:
// 1. What mysteryFunction1 does
// 2. What prints out for the value of y
// 3. What prints out for the value of z
// Now run the code and see if you're correct.
// Were you correct? If not, what did you learn?

/*--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The function will take in any number given to it and return that number multiplied by 2 (aka double it).

The value of Y = 4;
The value of Z = 8 (which the function returned by double Y)
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------*/





// Exercise 8. Read the following code (don't run it yet)

function mysteryFunction2(p1, p2) {
  const x = p1 - p2;
  return x;
}
const a = mysteryFunction2(10, 4);
const b = mysteryFunction2(a, 1);
console.log("The value of a is " + a);
console.log("The value of b is " + b);

// Without running the code, write down in a comment:
// 1. What mysteryFunction2 does
// 2. What prints out for the value of a
// 3. What prints out for the value of b
// Now run the code and see if you're correct.
// Were you correct? If not, what did you learn?

/*--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The function takes in two parameters, then uses subtraction in order to determine the difference, 
sets that difference as the value for X, and finally returns X.

The value of a = 6
The value of b = 5
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------*/





// Exercise 9. This exercise is to practice reading the documentation for functions.
// String.split() is a function in the JavaScript standard library that you can use in your code.
// Read about the split() function here: https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/String/split
// Try to use it to solve the following challenges:

// Here's a string I made representing my grocery list.
// Using split() and groceryList, make an array of my grocery list items

const groceryList = "eggs,carrots,orange juice";

const groceryListArray = groceryList.split(',');
console.log(groceryListArray);

  /*I had to add a comma in the parenthesis to make sure orange Juice is one word 
  and also had to make sure there was no spaces. 
  It is probably because the .split() method looks for a pattern that you can set 
  and uses that to try and split the strings in that pattern into an array?*/



// Here's a string I made representing my morning schedule.
// Using split() and mySchedule, make an array of the *first 2* things I do in the morning
// There are multiple ways to do this, but try doing it using only the split() function.

const mySchedule = "wake up--->brush teeth--->eat breakfast--->go to work";
const myScheduleArray = mySchedule.split("--->")
/*The ---> was necessary in order to tell .split() the pattern in which to split the strings into each element.*/

const firstTwoOfSchedule = myScheduleArray.slice(0, 2);
console.log(firstTwoOfSchedule);





// Congrats, you made it to the end!
// Did you find this easy or hard? If you used references, which ones helped you?
// Please answer in a comment below.

/* The exercise wasn't too diffcicult but playing around with the .split() method was a lot of fun, 
trying out diffrent inputs for what seperator to use in the method and watching the outcome.*/
