//Week 3 - Arrays and Objects

// In the following exercises, you will need to place your code or answer underneath each
// exercise prompt.

// First try answering these without using references or looking up any information.
// Then, check your answer by using references and/or running your code.
// You can run your JS code using the Chrome or Firefox Developer tools, or by using Node.js.
// Feel free to update your answers if you got them wrong at first -- this exercise is for your own learning.
// But make sure you understand why the correct answer is right.

// Exercise 1. Make an empty array named animals

let animals = [];
console.log(animals);




// Exercise 2. Add the string "frog" to the array

animals[0] = "frog";
console.log(animals);



// Exercise 3. Add 4 more animals of your choice to the array. Try to add all of them in one line of code.

animals.push("dog", "cat", "lion", "turtle");
console.log(animals);



// Exercise 4. Update the first item in the array to be "gorilla"

animals.unshift("gorilla")
console.log(animals);





// Exercise 5. Print the number of items in the array (use the array property that will give you this information)

console.log(animals.length);





// Exercise 6. Print the first item in the array

console.log(animals[0]);





// Exercise 7. Print the last item in the array (as part of your answer, use the same array property you used in exercise 5 above)

console.log(animals[animals.length - 1]); //This takes the length of the array but subtracts 1 because array indexes start at 0





// Exercise 8. Remove the last item from the array

animals.pop();
console.log(animals);





// Exercise 9. Now make a new array named assortedThings that contains at least 3 strings and 3 numbers.

let assortedThings = ["one", "two", "three", 4, 5, 6];





// Exercise 10. Write a for loop that iterates through the assortedThings array and prints each index and item, such as:
// Item #0 is potato
// Item #1 is 4
// Item #2 is Hello World
// ...

for(i = 0; i < assortedThings.length; i++){
  console.log(`Item # ${i} is ${assortedThings[i]}`);
};





// Exercise 11. Write a function that takes an array of numbers as a parameter. For each number in the array,
// print the number and "BIG" if it's over 100, "small" if it's between 0 and 100, and "negative" if
// it's less than 0. Example:
// if the array is [-2, 200, 50], print:
// -2 negative
// 200 BIG
// 50 small
//
// Then write some function calls you would use to test your function.

let firstTestArray = [-1, 88, 108]; //Output = Negative, Small, BIG
let secondTestArray = [-8, "Three", "Twenty", "Dont Error", 108] //output = Negative, NaN, Nan, Nan, BIG

function isItBigOrSmall (array1){
  for(i = 0; i < array1.length; i++){
    if(array1[i] > 100){
      console.log(`${array1[i]} BIG`);
    } else if (array1[i] < 100 && array1[i] >= 0){
      console.log(`${array1[i]} Small`);
    } else if(array1[i] < 0){
      console.log(`${array1[i]} Negative`);
    } else {
      console.log("Value inputed is not a number");
    }
  }
}

isItBigOrSmall(firstTestArray);
isItBigOrSmall(secondTestArray);





// Exercise 12. Make an object called me that contains the following keys: name, favoriteAnimal, favoriteNumber
// The values of those keys can be whatever you choose.

let me = {
  name: "Alex",
  favoriteAnimal: "Cheetah",
  favoriteNumber: 8
}

console.log(me);





// Exercise 13. Add another 2 keys and values to the object (you choose what they are)

let addToMeObject = {
  currentMood: "Excited",
  currentenergy: "110%"
}

Object.assign(me, addToMeObject); //I just learned this method and I love it! It blew my mind!!
console.log(me);





// Exercise 14. Update the favoriteAnimal value to something different

me.favoriteAnimal = "Otter"; //Dot notation
console.log(me);
me["favoriteAnimal"] = "Otters!"; //Bracket notation but must quotation the key's name
console.log(me);





// Exercise 15. Print the value of favoriteAnimal.
// Note: there are at least 2 ways to get the value of a key, try to write both.

console.log(me.favoriteAnimal);//Dot notation
console.log(me["favoriteAnimal"]);//Bracket notation

I have been messing around with arrays and objects a lot lately so it was a bit easy compared to a month ago when I had barely practiced using them.
